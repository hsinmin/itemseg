Itemseg is a 10-K item segmentation tool for processing
 10-K reports and extract item-specific text. 
Itemseg supports the following input format:
* raw: Complete submission text file. See example at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000156459020034944/0001564590-20-034944.txt
* html: 10-K report in HTML format. See example file at https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000156459020034944/msft-10k_20200630.htm
* native_text: 10-K report in pure text format. See example at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000103221001501099/d10k.txt
* cleaned_text: 10-K report converted to the pure text formated with tables removed.

The input file (--input) can be either a local file or an URL pointing to the SEC website. 

Itemseg supports the following item segmentation approach:
* crf: conditional random field. Recommended for machines without no GPU.
* lstm: Bi-directional long short-term memory.
* bert: BERT encoder coupled with bi-lstm.
* chatgpt: Use openai api and line-id-based prompting.

## Installation

We recommend to install itemseg in a separate environment created by virtualenv. This setup can prevent library version conflicts. The instructions below has been tested with Ubuntu 22 LTS and Mac OS 15.5. 

### Setup virtualenv
Install virtualenv first if it is not already installed. You can use other tools that support similar functionality (e.g. pipx)

For Ubuntu 22 LTS: 
```console
sudo apt instll python-virtualenv
```

For Mac OS:
```console
pip3 install virtualenv
```

The next step is to setup the virtualenv 
Ubuntu 22 LTS:
```console
virtualenv env_itemseg
```
Mac OS
```console
python3 -m venv env_itemseg
```

Activate the virtualenv
```console
source env_itemseg/bin/activate
```

Now we can install itemseg
```console
pip3 install itemseg
```

### Download resource file
You will need to download resource first before start using the tool.
```console
python3 -m itemseg --get_resource
```

### Download nltk data
```console
python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt punkt..
```

Alternatively, you can do the following:
Launch python3 console
```console
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Itemseg Example Usage
### Segment items in a 10-K file
Using Apple 10-K (2023) as an example:
```console
python3 -m itemseg --input_type html --input https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000106/0000320193-23-000106.txt --user_agent "Some University johndow@someuniversity.edu"
```

See the results in ./segout01/

The *.csv file contain line-by-line prediction for items in a Begin-Inside-Outside (BIO) style tags. Other files contain item-sepcific text. 

### About 10-K files. 
A 10-K report is an annual report filed by publicly traded companies with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and is more detailed than an annual report. Key items of a 10-K report include:

* Item 1 (Business): Describes the company's main operations, products, and services.
* Item 1A (Risk Factors): Outlines risks that could affect the company's business, financial condition, or operating results. 
* Item 3 (Legal Proceedings)
* Item 7 (Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; MD&A): Offers management's perspective on the financial results, including discussion of liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations.

You can search and read 10-K reports through the [EDGAR web interface](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access). The itemseg module takes the URL of the `Complete submission text file`, convert the HTML to formated txt file, and segment the txt file by items. 

As an example, the AMAZON 10-K report page for [fiscal year 2022](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000004/0001018724-23-000004-index.htm) shows the link to the HTML 10-K report and a `Complete submission text file` [0001018724-23-000004.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000004/0001018724-23-000004.txt). Pass this link (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000004/0001018724-23-000004.txt) to the itemseg module, and it will retrive the file and segment items for you. 

### todo:
```console
python3 -m itemseg --input https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000004/0001018724-23-000004.txt
```

The default setting is to output line-by-line tag (BIO style) in a csv file, together with Item 1, Item 1A, Item 3, and Item 7 in separate files (--outfn_type "csv,item1,item1a,item3,item7"). You can change output file type combination with --outfn_type. For example, if you only want to output Item 1A and Item 7, then set --outfn_type "item1a,item7". 

If you are trying to process large amounts of 10-K files, a good starting point is the master index (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/full-index/), which lists all available files and provides a convenient venue to construct a comprehensive list of target files.

The module also comes with a script file that allow you to run the module via `itemseg` command. The default location (for Ubuntu) is at ~/.local/bin. Add this location to your path to enable `itemseg` command.
